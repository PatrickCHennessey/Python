# Exercise: Test both the object's size and proximity.

# Add the code to the cell below to create two variables: object_size and proximity.
# Set object_size to 10 to represent 10m3. Set proximity to 9000.

# Add code to display the following message:
# Evasive maneuvers required if both object_size is greater than 5 and proximity is less than 1000.
# Otherwise display a message saying Object poses no threat.

object_size = 10
proximity = 9000
